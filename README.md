# uji

![uji icon](des/icon-colour@2x.png)

a silly app that just sends you a high priority notification every 18 minutes

based and named after [fewstuff](https://twitter.com/fewstufff/)'s original character
that is as follows:

> its a robot girl whos purpose is to announce every time 18 minutes have passed.
> based on my feelings OF USELESSNES and being liability at werk

botched together after also wanting to have something that bugs me every 18 minutes \
(and after needing an excuse to pick up kotlin and jetpack compose)
